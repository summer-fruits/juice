# `juice`

`juice` explores using [`buf`](https://buf.build) and the associated as Buf
Schema Registry (BSR) to share and generate schema definitions for APIs.

The BSR repository used in here is
[`summer-fruits/buf`](https://buf.build/summer-fruits/buf), the source for this
is under the same [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/summer-fruits/buf).
